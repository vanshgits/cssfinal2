            <h2>Jobs in Garage</h2>
            <p>
                    In the garage of Steve Jobs' childhood home in 1976, 
                    Apple was born. Co-founded by Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, the company embarked on 
                    a mission to bring personal computing to the masses. The release of the Apple I in 1976 marked the inception of a 
                    technological revolution. The iconic Macintosh followed in 1984, introducing the graphical user interface and forever changing the way we interact with computers.
